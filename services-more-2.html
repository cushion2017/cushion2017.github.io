					<h5>Cognitive Therapy</h5>
					<div class="line-text"></div>
					<p>Helps with thinking problems and recurring episodes of depression, Teaches people how to react to thoughts and feelings. Being similar to MDT, It is based on an educational model where people in therapy are helped to move on from negative thoughts and reaction.
