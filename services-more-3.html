					<h5>ACCEPTANCE AND COMMITMENT THERAPY</h5>
					<div class="line-text"></div>
					<p>Acceptance and communication therapy began in the late 1990s wanting to develop a science based, time limited intervention for people who may suffer from mental health. ACT was developed with the goal of teaching people that psychological pain is normal while learning ways to for fill life by shifting our way of thinking rather then avoiding it which creates more suffering.
Recent studies focus more on ways of dealing with life obstacles and accepting problems as they come without evaluating or attempting to change them encourages people to develop fresh and compassionate ways to deal with past negative experiences. If you can commit to this method you will learn to free yourself from the traps and barriers of life, and see what you really want your life to be. Techniques involve three step, being mindful, value and acceptance students should
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
Act on Value, Acceptance and Mindfulness 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
Value
<br> 
A value is a life direction, An internal compass which guide us through life. Values are different to goals which have an end point, Values are often life long in which we would like to be remembered for.
To identify our values, we can think about what it is in life that is really important to us, the most important, what gives our life meaning and purpose. Knowing our values will help us decide how to react to stress and distress. In spite of how we feel, we can still move in the direction and service of our values.
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
Acceptance
<br> 
An act is based on an idea generated in the mind. Sometimes an acts can manifests creating pressure on individuals creating an increase in pain and destress. If left to long this can turn into a problem which create trauma so the alternative is just to accept it. This doesn ºt mean giving up as if you are defeated or agreeing with suffering but to acknowledge a willingness to allow these experiences.
   
Acceptance is an acknowledgement of what may have happened with the willingness to allow the experience to teach individuals to make room for painful feelings, thoughts, and sensations.
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
Mindfulness
<br> 
Observing or experience in the present moment without judgment, Helping is to defuse and distract ourselves from unhelpful thoughts, reactions and sensations
and noticing what we don't normally notice.
Being mindful helps us to train our attention. Our minds wander about 50% of the time, but every time we practise being mindful, we are exercising our attention "muscle" and becoming mentally fitter. We can take more control over our focus of attention, and choose what we focus on, rather than passively allowing our attention to be dominated by that which distresses us and takes us away from the present moment.
Mindfulness might simply be described as choosing and learning to control our focus of attention, and being open, curious and flexible.
Bill Murray describes mindfulness as being "alert and available".
